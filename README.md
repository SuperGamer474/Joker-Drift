## 🎮 Gameplay

### 2-Player Mode
1. Both players **simultaneously** flip the top card of their deck.  
2. If it’s **black**:
   - Move your Joker **one space to the right**.  
   - Place that black card into the now-empty spot in your row.  
3. If it’s **red**:
   - Remove your **rightmost** black card.  
   - Pair it with the red card and place them **above** your row.  
4. **Repeat** steps 1–3 until:
   - **You clear all your black cards**.  
   - **Your deck runs out** while you still have black cards → you **lose**.  
5. **Endgame & Winning (2-Player):**  
   - If **both** players clear all black cards: count the **spaces** between your deck and your Joker. The **lower** count wins!
   - If tied on spaces: the player with **more cards left** in their deck wins.

### 1-Player Mode
- **Same rules**, but you’re racing **against yourself**!  
- **Goal:** Don’t let your Joker drift too far right, and if you clear your black cards, aim to have as **many cards** remaining in your deck as possible.  
- Keep track of your **best score** (least drift + max deck cards) and see how high you can climb!

## 🃏 Pro Tip
- **Hope for reds** but plan for blacks! 🔴⚫

> **⚠️ Important:** Your Joker marker only ever moves to the **right**—it can’t drift back left.

Good luck! 🎉
